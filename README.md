# AWSwebsite
For gaining familiarity with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript as well as AWS, created a website that is running on AWS Linux EC2 instance.

After run the website locally, uploaded my files to S3 Bucket on AWS. Next, sshed into the EC2 instance from my mac terminal, installed httpd and fetched files from the bucket.
